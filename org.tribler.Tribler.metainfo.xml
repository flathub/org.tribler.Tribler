  <summary>Towards making Bittorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down.</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Through our own dedicated Tor-like network for torrent downloading 
    you can search and download torrents with less worries or censorship. 
    We are trying to make privacy, strong cryptography and authentication the Internet norm.</p>
    <p>Do not put yourself in danger. Our anonymity is not yet mature.
    Tribler does not protect you against spooks and government agencies. 
    We are a torrent client and aim to protect you against lawyer-based attacks and censorship. 
    With help from many volunteers we are continuously evolving and improving.</p>
